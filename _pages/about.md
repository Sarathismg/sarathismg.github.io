Hi~ I am a fifth-year PhD student at Pennsylvania State University, advised by [Dr. Rui Zhang](https://ryanzhumich.github.io). Previously I have done my research internships in Microsoft Research and Amazon. 

Research Interests
======
My research interests broadly lie in investigating novel techniques for stronger and data-efficient Natural Language Processing, with a focus on:

- Strategy and Prompt Optimization for Better Reasoning (ICLR '25)
- Data and Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (EMNLP '23)
- Zero/Few Shot Learning (ACL 2022. ACL Findings '24)
